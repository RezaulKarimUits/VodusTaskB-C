In these project two task Home and Taskc two menu are on the top.
by default Taskb is shown in the ui and if you click task c then you will find assignment c.
For task b you can load data from json and pul from postgresql database
you can search by name and select date to filter.
For task c only html table shows by data from database
by clicking on table header you can sort them
also I create a table for columnconfigurator to keep the track of column visibility.
by these table we can hide or show column based on isvisible field.
from front end I am trying to select from dropdown with checkbox, but frontend part is remaining.
in the back end I Added an method to update the header visibility information.
